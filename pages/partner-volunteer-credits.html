                            <p>I am currently serving the citizens of Sandy Springs, Georgia as a GIS Analyst. I specialize in supporting the Public Works departments (Field Services, Stormwater, Utilities, and more) through asset management administration, web applications, mapping, and GIS analysis. I enjoy cartography and am always looking to learn more about spatial technologies and design. I am employed through InterDev, LLC a managed IT and security company.</p>
                            <p><strong>Contribution: </strong>I helped create the front page map showing rider and driver locations. This provided a live visualization of sign-ups in real-time, where drivers were needed, and the growth of our project. I also helped with quality control and testing. </p>

                        <h4>Patricia Canedo</h4><img class="align-right" src="images/volunteers/patricia-canedo.png" width=78 height=75 />
                            <p>I am Patricia, a young Spanish woman living in London with a deep interest in politics and current affairs. I finished a masters in International studies and Diolomacy from the University of London in 2015 and at the moment, I am working for the third sector. I took part in the project in a Media Relations role. This role involved helping the research team to locate the right media outlets and contacts in order to approach them and make them aware of the project and the possible impact of the voting laws on the result of the election. I enjoyed volunteering at carpool vote since I could use my communications knowledge and skills while aiming to create a change and help society as a whole.</p>

                            <p>I'm a farmer and a doula; fairly down-home, if I need to choose a type and I'm determined to help out with enabling citizens to get out and vote!  Many have died in order for us to have this precious right - we have a say in our governing ONLY if we VOTE.  And while I'm on the subject, voting for the locals who strongly effect my life is just as important as voting for the president - if not more so.</p>

                        <h4>Deb Steiner</h4><img class="align-right" src="images/volunteers/deb-steiner.png" width=78 height=75 />
                            <p>I was able to drive 3 voters to the polls on election day. One woman took her 3 children with her. We were able to buckle them all up in my backseat. I was thrilled to be able to help that day. I am a retired public school educator and believe in the importance of doing our civic duty of voting.</p>
