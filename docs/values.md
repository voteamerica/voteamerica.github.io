# <u>Carpool Vote values</u>  

- **Justice/Democracy/civil liberties**: Giving every American the right to vote 
- **Collaboration**: We’re supported by a network of self-organising volunteers  
- **Community/Inclusiveness/love**: Anybody can have a ride - people of color, with disabilities, young people, women, anyone else - and we’re introducing people who would otherwise not have met 
- **Progressive social movement**: getting young people involved in exciting cause to rally behind, so they can also actively participate in democratic process  
- **Empowering/subversive**: giving people control of their own destiny; stepping in where legislation has failed; involving people who use our services in other aspects of the volunteer process; educating people on who they can get their vote out (with the help of our partners)  
- **Nonpartisan/patriotic**: this is for the good of democracy and freedom 
- **Simple/Easy to help**: simplicity is key here. We don’t’ want people to feel like it will be complicated to get inovled
